    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally
        from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
        <hr>
        junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a<br>
        younger male may be called cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
        An
    <h1>adult female</h1> bird <sub>is</sub> called a hen, and a <h2>sexually</h2> immature female is called a pullet. </p>


    <p>Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.
        Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
        domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.
